## My process
I just adapted simplest way possible to get the required design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I am planning to give my priority to core concepts rather than the Frameworks. This will help me to adapt new frameworks which are yet to come but core concepts will always be similar as it is now.
